**SINGAPORE FLAT RESALE PREDICTION**

**INTRODUCTION**

The objective of the singapore flat resale price prediction is to predict the resale price of the flats based on locations, different types of buildings, floor area and remaining lease. The application gives the resale price predicition based on the user inputs.

**Python Libraries**

The following mentioned libraries are used to build the application

**Scikit-learn**: import sklearn

**IMBlearn**: from imblearn.combine import SMOTEENN

**Pandas, Numpy**:	import pandas as pd, import numpy as np

**Dash board libraries**-**Streamlit, Seaborn, Matplotlib**:	import streamlit as st, import seaborn as sns, from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

**Data preprocessing and Data Visualization**

Data preprocessing was performed using pandas, numpy and data visualization was performed using seaborn and matplotlib. After the data preprocessing regression model
was built using sklearn. Randomforest regressor gave an testing accuracy of 97.9 % for prediciting the resale price of the flats.
